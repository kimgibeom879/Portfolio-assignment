    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>
      Hello, I am Gibeom Kim. A korean raised in the Philippines at age 2. I've been studing there until 2020 together with my family. It was a precious experience and a 
      opportunity to learn english abroad. I came to the Canada because my brother enrolled in UofT at 2018. My family followed my brother later because of the covid-19 outbreak.
